## Accepted MVP Risks (Track and Monitor)

| Risk ID | Accepted Risk | Owner | Monitoring Control | Review Cadence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| K-01 | SMS failover architecture exists, but warm-standby provider is not yet launch-validated until outage drill passes | TBD | Outage drill + provider health alerts + failover test evidence | Weekly | OPEN |
| K-02 | Background checks are manual in MVP | TBD | SOP adherence + audit sample review | Bi-weekly | OPEN |
| K-03 | In-app analytics only (no external BI) | TBD | Dashboard accuracy checks + metric reconciliation | Weekly | OPEN |

## Gate Decision Rule

- `PASS`: All critical items complete (`R-01..R-06`, `D-01..D-05`, `I-01..I-04`, `M-01..M-08`, `S-01..S-04`, `O-01..O-08`, `T-01..T-08`).
- `CONCERNS`: Non-critical items pending with owner and target date assigned.
- `FAIL`: Any critical security, tenant isolation, audit integrity, or core messaging item incomplete.
