# CBLAero - Epic Breakdown

## Overview

This document provides the complete epic and story breakdown for CBLAero, decomposing the requirements from the PRD, UX Design, and Architecture requirements into implementable stories.

## Requirements Inventory

### Functional Requirements

FR1: System can ingest candidate records from bulk CSV upload (up to 1M records initial load, then daily/weekly recruiter uploads of 100-10,000 records); upload must validate, deduplicate, and report import errors per row with a downloadable error report.
FR1a: System can perform initial bulk load of up to 1M existing candidate records via a one-time admin-supervised migration pipeline; load must complete within a time-bounded batch window with progress tracking and rollback capability.
FR2: System can ingest candidate data automatically from configured ATS system connectors (read-only API polling or webhook) and recruiter email inboxes (Microsoft Graph mail parsing); new or updated records are upserted via the standard deduplication pipeline with source attribution.
FR3: System can store and index candidate profiles with core attributes (name, phone, email, location, skills, certifications, experience, availability status).
FR4: System can deduplicate candidate records with deterministic merge policy: auto-merge at >=95% identity confidence, manual-review queue at 70-94%, keep separate below 70%.
FR5: System can track candidate availability status (active, passive, unavailable) using self-reported status plus engagement events from the previous 90 days.
FR6: System can archive candidate records indefinitely with 5-year queryable retention and 7-year cold storage; implement GDPR right-to-be-forgotten deletion policy.
FR7: Recruiter can view complete candidate profiles including enriched data (company history, skills, location, match reason).

FR29: System can validate availability signals by comparing stated availability against engagement activity from the prior 90 days and marking stale signals older than 7 days.
FR30: System can compute seriousness state (High, Medium, Low) from behavioral responses (tool ownership, badge readiness, decision timeline) using explicit scoring rules.
FR31: System can screen for mandatory domain requirements (A&P certification, airport badge eligibility, no felony records).

### Additional Requirements

- Architecture mandates Next.js App Router TypeScript baseline as project starter; Epic 1 Story 1 must initialize from this baseline before feature work.
- Initial one-time 1M-record load must use an admin-supervised migration path, not the regular recruiter upload UI.
- Recruiter CSV upload path must support mapping wizard, live validation preview, per-row error report download, and max 10,000 records per upload.
- ATS and recruiter-email ingestion paths must use source attribution and must never silently discard sync failures.
- Deduplication runs asynchronously; imported records move through pending states before activation.
- Candidate list/search at 1M+ scale requires cursor pagination and indexed pre-filters; no unfiltered show-all table mode.
- Outbox event generation must be transactional with state mutation; fire-and-forget webhook callbacks are not acceptable for critical event pipeline.
- Outreach and notification operations require idempotency keys, bounded retries, and dead-letter classification.
- Public candidate links require one-time token handling, expiry, replay protection, and endpoint rate limiting.
- High-impact actions (bulk changes, exports, compliance overrides) require human-in-the-loop confirmation.
- Every decision/action path must be tenant-scoped and correlation-ID traceable in append-only audit history.
- Goal execution requires hard max iterations and max consecutive failures before enforced pause/escalation.
- Communication UX must enforce candidate contact windows and include pause availability controls without forcing global opt-out.
- Candidate portal should support see-before-share trust pattern and transparent preference controls.
- Recruiter experience must support motivation-first ranking context and visible rejection reasons with controlled override path.
- Dashboard UX must scale from top-5 action view to larger queues via progressive disclosure without overwhelming users.
- Teams outage and provider outage fallback UX must route users to alternate channel notifications and visible status.

## Story Sizing Baseline (One-Week Ideal, Two-Week Max)

- Strategic epics above are product-value containers.
- Delivery planning should use timeboxed execution epics below.
- S = 1-2 dev days (small, low integration)
- M = 3-4 dev days (moderate integration across 1-2 services)
- L = 5+ dev days (must be split before commitment)

## 4-Week Plan by Strategic Epic (9 Epics, Parallel)

### Plan Rules

- This plan executes and tracks work at the 9-epic level; package mapping below is FYI only.
- Target remains full product completion by end of Week 4.
- Each epic should be 1 week ideal and 2 weeks maximum.
- Per-person WIP cap is 2 concurrent epics per week.
- Parallel execution is required; epics overlap by design.

### Required Delivery Capacity

- 2 squad members: squad-member-1 and squad-member-2.
- Work is split by epic ownership with daily integration sync to control dependency risk.

### 9-Epic Calendar

| Epic | Owner | Start | Finish | Dependency Gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Epic 1: Platform Foundation, Access, and Tenant Security | squad-member-1 | Week 1 | Week 2 | None |
| Epic 2: Candidate Data Ingestion and Profile Lifecycle | squad-member-2 | Week 1 | Week 2 | Core platform contracts from Epic 1 frozen |

| Epic 6: Collaboration and Notification Workflows | squad-member-2 | Week 4 | Week 4 | Epic 4 and Epic 5 payload contracts frozen |
| Epic 7: Metrics, Cost Governance, and Forecasting | squad-member-1 | Week 3 | Week 3 | Workflow event streams and initial scoring outputs available |
| Epic 8: Compliance, Reliability, and Operational Guardrails | squad-member-2 | Week 3 | Week 4 | Security baseline from Epic 1 complete |
| Epic 9: Candidate Self-Service Portal Experience | squad-member-1 | Week 4 | Week 4 | Outreach tokens and Epic 4 workflow status APIs available |

### Weekly Objectives

- Week 1: Start Epic 1, Epic 2, Epic 3 in parallel; baseline implementation and integration lanes.
- Week 2: Complete Epic 1, Epic 2, Epic 3 and freeze shared contracts.
- Week 3: Execute Epic 4 and Epic 7 as one-week deliveries; start Epic 5 and Epic 8.
- Week 4: Complete Epic 5 and Epic 8; deliver Epic 6 and Epic 9; run end-to-end hardening.

### Critical Risk Note

- This 4-week target is feasible only with disciplined parallel staffing, strict WIP control, and contract freeze discipline.
- If any Week 3 dependency slips, immediately defer non-critical scope behind feature flags to preserve date.

## Epic 1: Platform Foundation, Access, and Tenant Security

Initialize the production foundation and enforce identity, authorization, and tenant boundaries before feature surfaces are exposed.

### Story 1.1: Initialize Next.js Baseline with Core Platform Modules

As a platform engineer,
I want to initialize the application from the approved Next.js TypeScript starter with module boundaries,
So that all subsequent stories build on a consistent architecture baseline.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** an empty application workspace
